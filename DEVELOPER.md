# Dev notice

If you are a developer, please attend the Thursday meetings after school. In addition, please join our discord server.

This application is developed using Flutter. More information for flutter can be found on <https://flutter.dev/>. It is encouraged for everyone who want to develop on the front end(the app itself) to learn flutter, especially if you want to work on the functionality of the app. For more information on the app, visit the GitHub repository and read the wiki that I wrote(shameless self-promotion time).

The GitHub repository for this app is <https://github.com/RageLeague/thirskOS>, but since you already read this, then you already know where the GitHub repo is.

If you intend to work on the backend of the app, go find Umut. He's the one dealing with all the backend stuff. The backend is in a seperate repository.

## Working on the front end of the app

If you are interested in working on the front end of this app, and already know how flutter works, then you need to know what specific functions that are added to help the development of this app. It is recommended to read the documentation for the various functions in the app.
